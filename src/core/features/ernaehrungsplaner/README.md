# Ern√§hrungsplaner

## Description

The nutrition planner determines the lunch break (free time in the timetable) and creates suggestions for a good, healthy lunch. It uses the work/university location from the preferences.

In the evenings, Carschten checks the inventory and suggests what can be cooked or what needs to be purchased.

Carschten knows from the preferences what the user likes and what should be considered.

The user can inquire about details at any time regarding:

- Restaurants
- Inventory
- Recipes
